            <h2>About our website</h2>
            <p>
                The primary aim of this website is to highlight the challenges faced by Indigenous women and children, 
                who often encounter exploitation and barriers to justice. The issues discussed in Kapalit ng Katahimikan 
                underscore the entrenched difficulties related to abuse, poverty, and lack of community support, which 
                perpetuate a cycle of suffering and trauma. Teenage pregnancy, frequently stemming from abuse or inadequate 
                access to reproductive health resources, complicates the lives of young women by affecting their education, 
                economic prospects, and social reputation.

            <h2>About our article</h2>
            <p>
                The repercussions of teenage pregnancy can be significant and long-lasting for young mothers, who frequently 
                experience disruptions in their education, reduced economic opportunities, and societal stigma. For many 
                Indigenous girls, these obstacles are even more pronounced due to their limited access to reproductive health 
                education, support networks, and healthcare services. By offering news articles, resources, and educational 
                material, our goal is to raise awareness about these issues and engage in discussions about the ongoing 
                initiatives to aid victims, advocate for justice, and lower the rates of teenage pregnancy. Through raising 
                consciousness, we seek to help establish a safer and more supportive community for everyone.
